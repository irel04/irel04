Hello! I am Irel Kian 👩‍💻 
============================================================================================================================================

Junior Software Developer
------------------------

I am a passionate and experienced Front-end Developer with several years of hands-on experience building web applications that are not only visually appealing but also scalable and maintainable. My journey in tech began in 2021 when I started coding with Python, which laid the foundation for my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. 

I developed my first website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and from there, my interest in web development quickly grew. I became captivated by the power and flexibility of React.js, which has since become my go-to framework for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Alongside React, I frequently utilize Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive styling, and I’m proficient with component libraries such as DaisyUI, Material UI, SHADCN, and Tailwind’s own UI toolkit to streamline development. 
My design process is strongly supported by my proficiency in Figma, where I leverage components, auto-layouts, and prototyping tools to bridge the gap between design and development effectively. 

While my core strength lies in front-end development, I’ve also explored the backend through internships and personal projects. I started backend development using Node.js and Express, and have since continued to upskill in modern backend frameworks like NestJS, Slim PHP, and Spring Boot. I’ve worked with relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL, and I’m also comfortable using NoSQL solutions like MongoDB and Firebase. 

In addition, I’ve gained knowledge in containerization and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, which has enhanced my understanding of scalable deployment environments. I also use Supabase as a Backend-as-a-Service platform for rapid prototyping and deployment. 
Driven by a desire to continuously learn and grow, I am always exploring new tools and technologies to sharpen my skills and expand my capabilities across the full development stack.
